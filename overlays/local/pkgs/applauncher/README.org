* My application launcher

I use =exwm= and =emacs-direnv= which is a fantastic combination.
What's not so fantastic is that when launcing applications from within emacs the direnv environment is inherited.

This behaviour is not desired for things like browser/terminal so I need a mechanism to launch applications using original environment.

My solution is a simple-ish server listening to application start requests on the dbus session bus.

** Usage
Call from emacs
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'dbus)
(dbus-call-method
 :session "com.github.adisbladis.AppLauncher"
 "/com/github/adisbladis/AppLauncher"
 "com.github.adisbladis.AppLauncher" "Start"
 '("urxvt"))
#+end_src
